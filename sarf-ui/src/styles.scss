// TODO(v15): As of v15 mat.legacy-core no longer includes default typography styles.
//  The following line adds:
//    1. Default typography styles for all components
//    2. Styles for typography hierarchy classes (e.g. .mat-headline-1)
//  If you specify typography styles for the components you use elsewhere, you should delete this line.
//  If you don't need the default component typographies but still want the hierarchy styles,
//  you can delete this line and instead use:
//    `@include mat.legacy-typography-hierarchy($custom-typography);`
@include mat.all-component-typographies($custom-typography);
@include mat.core();
// The following mixins include base theme styles that are only needed once per application. These
// theme styles do not depend on the color, typography, or density settings in your theme. However,
// these styles may differ depending on the theme's design system. Currently all themes use the
// Material 2 design system, but in the future it may be possible to create theme based on other
// design systems, such as Material 3.
//
// Please note: you do not need to include the 'base' mixins, if you include the corresponding
// 'theme' mixin elsewhere in your Sass. The full 'theme' mixins already include the base styles.
//

//
// TODO(v17): Please move these @include statements to the preferred place in your Sass, and pass
// your theme to them. This will ensure the correct values for your app are included.
